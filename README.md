## Pokemon: Next.js Data Fetching with PokeAPI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and developed with Typescript. TailwindCSS is used for styling.

### Assumptions & Design Decisions

1. `Finding Pokemon` is implemented using useState.
2. No Pokemons can be added to the team once the maximum size of 6 is reached. ("Add To Team" button will be hidden)

### Running Pokemon

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
